****Amís**, **a french noun for "friends", is also given new meaning by us to represent the acronym All Made In Sequence. The vision for this collective has been bouncing around in my head since 2012, before I was even much of an artist at all. Formerly using the term Another Man In Space, Amis is a vision that's slowly been coming together in my head over these past couple years. 

Growing up I was never surrounded by any creative influences and didn't have access to creative communities like most artists or musicians do, instead a lot of my time was spent in my room because where I lived was for the most part bland, empty and void literally speaking and also in terms of creativity & love. As an outlet much of my time spent indoors I was watching films, listening to music & browsing the internet gathering inspiration, another teen growing up in the age of information. Over time I started delving into graffiti, fashion, photography & design,  and eventually taught myself how to produce music on my computer and started rapping with friends in between as well. At 18, I moved back to California & over time wound up becoming friends with all kinds of different amazing, talented & unique people. I had also become more in tune with the spiritual side of myself & with that came a surge of awareness to the synchronicity all things, most notably the divine course the universe takes us all down & the sequences underlying the nature of creation. 

With all that said, that is what has inspired the formation of this collective so that you know where the roots of this platform are. Amis has now sprouted into a collective that had no boundaries or set aesthetic, simply a community of friends & artistic individuals that share one common interest, a love for the sequenced nature of creating. All Made In Sequence is a Northern California based Creation Collective aimed at bringing together a wise range of artistic, creative, adventurous, and unique individuals to create a community / environment / platform / influence, where we blur the lines between the many forms of artistic expression, where we can grow, inspire, teach, collaborate, etc. in a constructive manner, and where we will  materialize/showcase/distribute the works of the people involved.    _~ Randall Holmes_
